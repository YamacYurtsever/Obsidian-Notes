- A Central Processing Unit is the "brain" of a computer

### Von Neumann Architecture
![[Von Neumann Arcitechture.svg | 450]]


### Control Unit (CU)
- Manages and coordinates the operations of the CPU
- Generates **control signals** that regulate the activities of other CPU components
- Responsible of orchestrating the execution of instructions in the **correct order**
- Takes care of the **decoding** step in [[Machine Instruction Cycle]]

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Performs [[Arithmetic Operations | arithmetic operations]]: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- Performs [[Logic Gates | logic operations]]: AND, OR, NOT, ...
- Performs [[ARM Assembly#^3b3679 | comparison]]: greater than, equal to, less than
- Takes care of the **execute** step in [[Machine Instruction Cycle]]

### Registers
- Small and quickly accessible storage locations in the [[CPU]] to store data temporarily during processing
- *Program Counter (PC)*: Stores the [[Memory | memory]] address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed ^0aeee0
- *Instruction Register (IR)*: Holds the instruction that is currently being executed ^69d700
- *Memory Address Register (MAR)*: Stores the address of the data that will be fetched or stored ^a40da3
- *Memory Buffer Register (MBR)*: Stores the data that will be fetched or stored ^31a1d2

### System Buses
![[System Busses.png |450]]
- Connections that facilitate communication between the CPU, [[Memory| memory]] and peripherals
- *Control Bus:* Transmits control signals generated by the control unit to coordinate activities ^62759e
- *Address Bus:* Carries addresses of the locations where data needs to be read from or written to ^40e646
- *Data Bus:* Transfers data between the CPU and the other components of the computer ^516a41

! The [[Data Representation#^f57512 | bit]] size of a processor (e.g. 64-bit processor) refers to the size of each [[#Registers | register]] and [[#System Buses | bus]] ^349764
