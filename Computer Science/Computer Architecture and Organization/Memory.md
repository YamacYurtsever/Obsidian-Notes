### Primary Memory & Secondary Memory

| Primary (Main) Memory                            | Secondary Memory                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Short term storage                               | Long term storage                                                            |
| Contains less data                               | Contains more data                                                           |
| Faster to access ([[Memory Acess Order \| MAO]]) | Slower to access ([[Memory Acess Order \| MAO]])                             |
| Can be directly accessed by the CPU at run time  | First needs to be transferred to the main memory to be accessible by the CPU |
| E.g.: RAM, ROM and Virtual Memory                | E.g.: Hard drives, SSDs, USBs, CDs, Cloud Storage                            | 

### Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Where data is stored at runtime
- Can be written and read quickly
- Volatile (information is lost when power is turned off)

### Read Only Memory (ROM)
- Contains instructions, that are written in manufacturing, for booting the computer
- Can be read but can't be written easily
- Non-volatile (information is not lost when power is turned off)

### Virtual Memory
- Utilized when RAM is fully occupied, to extend available memory
- The [[Operating System | operating system]] temporarily transfers data from RAM to a designated space on the hard drive
- Contains the less important or less frequently accessed data
- Slower than RAM
