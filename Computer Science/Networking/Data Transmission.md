#### Types of Transmission (According to Order of Communication)
| Simplex Communication | Duplex Communication     | Half-Duplex Communication |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| One Direction         | Both Directions          | Taking Turns              |
| E.g.: Radio           | E.g.: Phone Conversation | E.g.: Walkie Talkie       |

#### Types of Transmission (According to Way of Transmission)

| Serial Transmission                                   | Parallel Transmission                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| The bits that make up the data are sent one at a time | All bits that make up the data are sent at the same time |
| All bits travel along the same medium                 | The bits travel along the different mediums              |
| Reliable                                              | Not Reliable                                             |
| Slow                                                  | Quick                                                    |
| Used for long distance transmission                   | Used for short distance transmission                     |
| E.g.: Internet                                        | E.g.: Communication between computer parts               | 

#### Packet Switching
- **Definition**: 
Packet switching is a method of [[Network | network]] communication where data is broken down into smaller units called packets
 - **Packets**: 
 These packets are discrete blocks of data that contain both the actual information being transmitted and control information, such as source and destination addresses ^206809
- **Routing**: 
Each packet is individually routed through the [[Network | network]] to its destination based on the most efficient path available at that moment
- **Reassembly**: 
Upon reaching the destination, the packets are reassembled in the correct order to reconstruct the original message or data
