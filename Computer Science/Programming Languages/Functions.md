- Functions (also called Methods) are named blocks of code that perform a specific task or set of tasks
- They compartmentalize the code into functional sections which makes it easier to understand
- Functions can be reused, thus reducing redundant code

```C
return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // function body
    return return_value;
}
```
