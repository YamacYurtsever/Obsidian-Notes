- Named containers or storage locations that hold data values
- These data values can be manipulated, accessed, and modified during the execution of a program
  
### Declaration and Initialization:

##### Declaration:
- Variables must be declared before they are used
- The declaration specifies the variable's name and type.

##### Initialization:
- The process of assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration
```C
int a;     // Decleration
int b = 5: // Initialization 
```

### Primitive and Composite Variables

##### Primitive Variables
- The most fundamental and elementary data types in a programming language
- int, short, long, float, double, char, bool, pointer

##### Composite Variables
- Complex data structures that are composed of primitive data types or other composite variable types
- User Defined Variables (struct or class), data structures, strings

### Scope of Variables

##### Local Variables
- Declared within a block and have limited scope

##### Global Variables
- Accessible throughout the entire program.

### Static vs Dynamic Typing
| Static Typing                                                                                                                                                                          | Dynamic Typing                                                                                      |

| The data type of a variable is known at compile-time                                                                                                                                   | The data type of a variable is determined at runtime                                                |
| The programmer must explicitly declare the data type of each variable, and the compiler checks that the types are used consistently throughout the code before the program is executed | Variable types are not explicitly declared, and they can change during the execution of the program |
| E.g.: Python, Javascript                                                                                                                                                               | E.g.: C, C++, C#, Java                                                                                    |
