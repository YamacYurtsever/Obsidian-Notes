- Allocating and deallocating memory resources effectively to ensure that programs run smoothly without memory-related issues like leaks or access violations

### Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection):
-  The runtime environment is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory automatically, identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use
- This reduces the risk of memory leaks, but it introduces some overhead
- E.g.: Python, Javascript, Java

### Manual Memory Management
- The programmer has explicit control over allocating and deallocating memory
- While this provides flexibility, it also introduces the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers if not handled carefully
- E.g.: C, C++
