#### SQL Injection Attacks:
- Malicious users can inject malicious SQL code into input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even data loss
- **Example**: Using SQL queries through interpolation can be vulnerable. For instance, a hacker might end a field with `"--`, effectively finishing the double quotes in the code early and commenting out the rest.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection:
```python
db.execute("UPDATE posts SET likes = ? WHERE id = ?", likes + 1, id)
```

#### Race Conditions:
- Concurrent execution of multiple transactions can lead to unpredictable outcomes, such as data inconsistencies or lost data
- **Example**: If multiple lines of code are being used for a database query, multiple instructions from different users may start running before the other has finished, interrupting the first instruction or losing data
- Use transactions and locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`): 
```SQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Perform Operations
COMMIT; -- Or ROLLBACK if Necessary
```
