#### SQL Injection Attacks:
- Malicious users can inject malicious SQL code into input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even data loss
- For instance, if SQL queries are done through interpolation, a hacker might end a field with `--` thius
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

#### Race Conditions:
- Concurrent execution of multiple transactions can lead to unpredictable outcomes if proper synchronization mechanisms are not in place, potentially causing data inconsistencies.
- Use transactions and locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations. Implement isolation levels based on the application's requirements.
