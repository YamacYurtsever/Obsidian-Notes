AJAX
- Asynchronous javascript and XML is a set of web development techniques that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with the server behind the scenes
- This means that instead of reloading the entire web page when a user performs an action, such as submitting a form, only the specific part of the page that needs to be updated is refreshed
