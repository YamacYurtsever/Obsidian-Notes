- Systems that records changes to a file or a set of files over time

### Central

### Key Concepts:

- **Repository:**
	- A database that stores all the files, directories, and the history of changes for a project
- **Commit:**
	 - A snapshot of the project at a specific point in time
- **Branching:**
	- Allows for the creation of divergent lines of development called branches
	- Developers can work on a feature or bug fix in isolation without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merging:**
	- The process of combining changes from different branches
- **Checkout:**
    - Switching between different branches or versions of the code.
- **Conflict**
    - Occur when changes made in one branch cannot be automatically merged with changes in another
    - Manual intervention is required to resolve conflicts.
