### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Frequent merges to the Main [[Git#Branching | Branch]] in the [[Version Control System | VCS]]
	- Rather than separately working on different features and then merging them at the end when finished
- Automated [[Testing#Unit Testing | unit testing]] on every [[Git#^eab429 | push]] or [[Version Control System#^3d24fc | merge]]
	- E.g.: [[Git#CI With GitHub | GitHub Actions]]
  
### Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Frequent small releases
	- Rather than rare large updates
