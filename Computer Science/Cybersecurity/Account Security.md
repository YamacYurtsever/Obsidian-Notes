#### Authentication
- Proving one's identity

#### Authorization
- Determining weather someone should have access to something

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Using multiple different types of factors for authentication
- E.g.:
	- *Knowledge* -> Password
	- *Possession* -> SMS
	- *Inheritance* -> Biometrics
	  
#### One-Time Password
- An automatically generated password that is valid for a single use
  
#### Single Sing-on
- Allowing users to log in once to access multiple applications or services
- E.g.: Google Auth

#### Password Manager
- A tool that helps users create, store, and manage complex and unique passwords for different applications
- Single point of failure, so not having access to your password manager means not having access to all other apps

#### Passkeys
- Keys used with a mathematical algorithm to serve as a shared secret for secure communication or accessing encrypted information

! As the security mechanisms increase, the usability might decrease, thus finding a balance between usability and security is crucial
