#### Rainbow Tables
- Precomputed tables for storing the outputs of a cryptographic [[Hash Tables#Hash Function | hash function]]
- Consist of a large number of precomputed hash values for a wide range of possible inputs, typically covering common and easily guessable passwords

#### Ransomware
- [[Data Security#Ciphers | Encrypting]] certain data and asking for money for the key to decrypt it

#### Quantum Computing
- A field of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform certain types of computations more efficiently than classical computers
- Unlike classical computers, which use [[Data Representation#^f57512 | bit]] to represent information as either a 0 or a 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" which can exist in multiple states between 0 and 1 simultaneously, thanks to a phenomenon called superposition
- If people with bad intentions have access to quantum computing before encryption algorithms can be adjusted, it can be used to break [[Data Security#Ciphers | Encryption] algorithms that were impossible to break
