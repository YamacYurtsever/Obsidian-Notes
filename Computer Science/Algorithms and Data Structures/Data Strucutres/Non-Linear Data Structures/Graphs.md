- Consists of a set of nodes (vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes
- Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities

#### Terms
-  **Nodes (Vertices)**:
	- Nodes represent entities or points in a graph
	- Each node can hold additional information, such as labels or attributes
- **Edges**:
	- Edges connect pairs of nodes and represent relationships between them
- **Weighted Edges**:
	- Edges can be assigned weights or costs to represent quantities such as distance, time, or any other relevant metric
- **Adjacency:**
	- Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them
- **Degree**:
	- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it
