- ADTs are high-level, abstract representations of data structures that define a set of operations without specifying how these operations are implemented.
- They focus on what operations can be performed on the data, not how they are implemented.

- Concrete data types, on the other hand, refer to specific implementations of data structures with details about how the data is stored and how operations are performed
- Concrete data types provide a detailed, specific representation of the data structure, including the organization of memory and algorithms for various operations
