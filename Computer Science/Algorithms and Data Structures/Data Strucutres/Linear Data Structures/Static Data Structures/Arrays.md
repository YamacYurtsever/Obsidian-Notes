- A data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index
- Arrays are used to organize and store data in a sequential manner, where each element can be accessed directly by its position in the array
- The index usually starts from 0, and the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations

#### Key Operations
- **Declaration**: Declares the type of elements the array will hold and specifies its size
- **Initialization**: Initializes the array with values at the time of declaration
```C
int numbers[5]; // Decleration
int values[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Decleration & Initialization
```
- **Accessing**:
```C
int third_element = numbers[2]
```
