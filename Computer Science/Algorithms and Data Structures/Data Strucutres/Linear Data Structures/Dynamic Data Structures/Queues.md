- A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle
- In a queue data structure, elements are added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). 
- This ensures that the oldest element in the queue is the next one to be processed.

###
Enqueue: This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue.

Dequeue: This operation removes an element from the front of the queue.

Additionally, there are two other common operations:

Peek (or Front): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

IsEmpty: Checks whether the queue is empty or not.

Queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements of the application.

Here's a simple example of a queue implemented using an array in a programming language like Python:
